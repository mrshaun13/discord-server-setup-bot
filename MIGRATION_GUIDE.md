# üîÑ Migration Guide for Pre-Existing Setups

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem

If you deployed the tracking system update to a server with **pre-existing bot-created channels**, the cleanup function won't recognize them because they don't have the `[DSBOT]` marker.

## ‚úÖ Solution

The bot now includes **two solutions**:

### Solution 1: Automatic Pattern Detection (No Action Required)

The bot now automatically detects likely bot-created channels using pattern matching:

**How it works:**
- Checks for `[DSBOT]` marker first (new channels)
- Falls back to pattern matching for old channels
- Recognizes common channel names from all templates

**Recognized Patterns:**
```
welcome, rules, announcements, resources, roles
general, introductions, off-topic, showcase
ai-news, research-papers, ethics-safety
general-dev, llm-development, ml-engineering
homework-help, general-academic, mathematics
... and many more
```

**What this means:**
- `\!cleanup` now works on pre-existing setups
- No manual action required for most cases
- Old channels are automatically recognized

---

### Solution 2: Migration Command (Recommended for Full Control)

Add `[DSBOT]` markers to your existing channels for explicit tracking.

#### Step 1: Run Migration Command

```bash
\!migrate-markers
```

#### Step 2: Confirm

```bash
\!confirm_migrate
```

#### What It Does

1. **Scans all channels** in your server
2. **Identifies bot-created channels** using pattern matching
3. **Adds `[DSBOT]` marker** to channel topics
4. **Adds `[DSBOT]` marker** to role names
5. **Reports results** - what was migrated vs skipped

#### Example Output

```
‚úÖ Migration complete\!
Migrated: 25 channels, 6 roles
Skipped: 3 channels, 2 roles

Migrated items now have [DSBOT] markers and will be recognized by \!cleanup.
```

## üéØ When to Use Each Solution

### Use Automatic Detection (Do Nothing)
‚úÖ You trust the pattern matching  
‚úÖ Your channels follow standard naming  
‚úÖ You want zero-effort solution  
‚úÖ You're okay with pattern-based detection

### Use Migration Command
‚úÖ You want explicit tracking  
‚úÖ You have custom channel names  
‚úÖ You want full control  
‚úÖ You want to see what gets marked

---

## üìä Comparison

| Feature | Automatic Detection | Migration Command |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Effort** | Zero | One command |
| **Accuracy** | Pattern-based | Explicit markers |
| **Visibility** | Transparent | Shows what's marked |
| **Reversible** | N/A | Can edit topics |
| **Custom names** | May miss some | Marks matched patterns |

---

## üîç How to Check What Will Be Detected

### Check Individual Channel

```bash
\!cleanup channel-name
```

If it says "not created by bot", the channel isn't recognized.

### Check All Channels

Run migration in dry-run mode (shows what would be migrated):
```bash
\!migrate-markers
# Review the list
# Cancel if you don't want to proceed
```

---

## üí° Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Template Setup

**Situation:** You used `\!setup ai-dev` before the tracking update.

**Solution:** Do nothing\! Automatic detection will work.

**Why:** Standard template channels match known patterns.

---

### Scenario 2: Custom Channel Names

**Situation:** You manually renamed channels after setup.

**Solution:** Use `\!migrate-markers` or `\!remove-channel` for cleanup.

**Why:** Custom names won't match patterns.

---

### Scenario 3: Mixed Setup

**Situation:** Some channels from bot, some manual.

**Solution:** Use `\!migrate-markers` to mark bot channels.

**Why:** Explicit markers prevent accidental deletion of manual channels.

---

### Scenario 4: Want to Start Fresh

**Situation:** Want to remove old setup and start over.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option A: Use cleanup (recognizes patterns)
\!cleanup
\!confirm_cleanup

# Option B: Migrate first, then cleanup
\!migrate-markers
\!confirm_migrate
\!cleanup
\!confirm_cleanup
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Pattern Matching Limitations

**Will be detected:**
- Standard template channel names
- Common patterns (welcome, rules, general, etc.)
- Channels matching `BOT_CHANNEL_PATTERNS` list

**Won't be detected:**
- Custom renamed channels
- Channels with non-standard names
- Manually created channels (this is good\!)

### Migration Safety

**Safe:**
- Only adds markers to matched patterns
- Doesn't delete anything
- Reversible (edit channel topics)
- Shows what will be migrated before proceeding

**Note:**
- Voice channels may not support topics (skipped)
- Requires confirmation before running
- Rate-limited to avoid API issues

## üöÄ Quick Start for Pre-Existing Setups

### Option 1: Trust Automatic Detection (Recommended)

```bash
# Just use cleanup as normal
\!cleanup
\!confirm_cleanup

# It will automatically detect old bot channels
```

### Option 2: Explicit Migration

```bash
# Step 1: Migrate markers
\!migrate-markers
\!confirm_migrate

# Step 2: Verify (check channel topics for [DSBOT])

# Step 3: Use cleanup as normal
\!cleanup
\!confirm_cleanup
```

---

## üìù Verification

### Check if Channel is Marked

1. Right-click channel ‚Üí Edit Channel
2. Look at Topic/Description
3. If it starts with `[DSBOT]`, it's marked

### Check if Role is Marked

1. Server Settings ‚Üí Roles
2. Look at role names
3. If it ends with `[DSBOT]`, it's marked

---

## üîÑ Rollback

### Remove Markers from Channels

```bash
# Manually edit each channel
Right-click ‚Üí Edit Channel ‚Üí Remove [DSBOT] from topic
```

### Remove Markers from Roles

```bash
# Manually edit each role
Server Settings ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Remove [DSBOT] from name
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will cleanup delete my old bot-created channels?**  
A: Yes\! Automatic pattern detection recognizes them.

**Q: Do I need to run migrate-markers?**  
A: No, but it's recommended for explicit tracking.

**Q: What if I have custom channel names?**  
A: Use `\!remove-channel` for those, or add them to the pattern list.

**Q: Can I undo migration?**  
A: Yes, manually edit channel topics to remove `[DSBOT]`.

**Q: Will this affect new setups?**  
A: No, new setups automatically get markers.

**Q: What if migration misses some channels?**  
A: Use `\!remove-channel` to delete them individually.

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Summary

**For Pre-Existing Setups:**

1. **Automatic detection works** - No action required for standard templates
2. **Migration available** - Use `\!migrate-markers` for explicit tracking
3. **Cleanup now works** - Both old and new channels recognized
4. **Safe by default** - Manual channels still protected

**Your pre-existing setup is now fully supported\!** üöÄ
