# 🔐 Security Notice

## ✅ Repository is Clean

This repository has been verified to contain **NO sensitive information**:

- ✅ No Discord bot tokens
- ✅ No API keys
- ✅ No passwords
- ✅ No server IDs

## 🛡️ What's Protected

The following files are in `.gitignore` and will **NEVER** be committed:

- `.env` - Contains your actual Discord token
- `*.log` - Log files that may contain sensitive data
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache
- `venv/` - Virtual environment

## 📝 .env.example

The `.env.example` file contains only placeholders:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN>
GUILD_ID=<YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER_ID>
```

## ⚠️ Important: Regenerate Your Discord Token

**CRITICAL**: If your Discord bot token was previously exposed (even temporarily), you should:

1. Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Select your application
3. Go to "Bot" section
4. Click "Reset Token"
5. Copy the new token
6. Update your `.env` file with the new token

## 🔒 Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env`** - It's in `.gitignore`
2. **Never share your token** - Treat it like a password
3. **Regenerate if exposed** - Better safe than sorry
4. **Use environment variables** - Don't hardcode secrets
5. **Review before commit** - Always check `git diff`

## ✅ Verification

To verify no secrets in your repo:

```bash
# Check what will be committed
git status

# Check file contents
git diff

# Search for potential secrets
git log --all -p | grep -i "token"
git log --all -p | grep -i "password"
```
